# Azure Cloud Storage AND Database Project

This project demonstrates core Azure services using the Microsoft Learn sandbox, including:

- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure File Shares (SMB)
- Azure Table Storage
- Azure Cosmos DB

All screenshots were taken during hands‑on deployment and configuration.

# Additional Learning Completed

## Skillable Labs (DP‑900 Azure Data Fundamentals)

I completed the official Skillable labs covering:

- Explore relational data in Azure  
- Explore non-relational data in Azure  

These labs reinforced concepts around Azure SQL, NoSQL stores, and distributed cloud data systems.

---

## Microsoft Fabric – Data Engineering and Analytics

I also completed the Microsoft Fabric data analytics tutorial, gaining experience with:

- Fabric Data Factory pipelines (data ingestion and transformation)
- Fabric SQL Warehouse queries
- KQL databases and time‑series analysis
- Data preview, JSON ingestion, and real‑time streaming

This expanded my cloud analytics skills into the Microsoft Fabric ecosystem.
